* This is a new release.

* There is a note about use of a restrictive license in package RTriangle. I
hope to use an alternative library in future that is compatible with the GPL-3,
and have added mention of the more restrictive requirements for RTriangle in the
package documentation, the Description, and in the help for relevant functions
'DEL()' and 'DEL0()'.
