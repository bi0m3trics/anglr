## anglr 0.4.9

New package anglr. 

Thank you very much.

* local windows install, R 3.6.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

* This is a new release.

* There is a note about use of a restrictive license in package RTriangle. I
hope to use an alternative library in future that is compatible with the GPL-3,
so I thought this appropriate to use for now.
