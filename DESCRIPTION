Description: The anglr package aims to provide direct access to generic 3D 
 tools and provides a full suite of mesh-creation and 3D plotting functions. By 
 extending the 'rgl' package visualization functions and converters to the
 for the 'mesh3d' class a wide variety of complex spatial data can be brought
 into 3D scenes. These tools allow for spatial raster, polygons, and lines 
 that are common in GIS workflows to converted into mesh forms giving flexible
 control format conversion and integration of disparate data types. Vector and
 raster data can be seamlessly combined as meshes, and surfaces can be set to 
 have material properties based on data values or with image textures. Textures
 and other data combinations use geospatial map projection transformations to 
 map between coordinate systems, and can be easily visualized in an interactive
 scene at any step.
